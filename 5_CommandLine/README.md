# Command line usage
Godot works surprisingly well from the command line:

It also has a "headless" version for CI builds and automated tests. This looks interesting:

## Running scripts from the command line
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/editor/command_line_tutorial.html#running-a-script

I'm not sure if this has many practical applications (maybe for a game server?) but it seems neat.

```bash
$ godot -s hello.gd
OpenGL ES 3.0 Renderer: AMD Radeon HD 7800 Series
Hello, world!
```
